                    <p>As our dear Jorge Ben Jor once said. We have beautiful places, delicous food, contagious music and warm people.</p>
                    <p>Don't miss out on the opportunity to spend amazing days here, because we have a lot of stunning views around the country.</p>
                    <p>And, of course, sipping a Caipirinha.</p>

                            <p>A lot of young people, great pricing and also many things to do downtown. Always good to feel the breeze while walking by the beach at night.</p>

                            <p>I'd never been there but I will go there, asap. Everybody I know that went there says that it's one of the top 3 most beautiful things they've ever seen in their lives. Surreal.</p>

                            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                            <p>As an Architect, being in Ouro Preto is delighful for my eyes. Our Sacred Architecture is amazing and there are a lot of churches to visit in Ouro Preto. It's just mesmerazing. The amount of gold on those walls! Besides, the history of the city holds big relevance in the colonization process of Brazil. It's really worth the visit.</p>
